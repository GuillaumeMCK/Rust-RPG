> A project to learn Rust. It's using the [GGez](https://ggez.rs/) game engine.
> The game logic is based on a OOP subject given during my studies at the ASTON School of Computer Science in France.

## Rust

### What is Rust?

Rust is a multi-paradigm, open-source programming language that prioritizes performance and safety,
particularly in concurrency, and can be used for a range of applications, including operating systems,
browsers, and embedded devices. It offers both high-level and low-level abstractions to make programming
more efficient and secure.

### How Rust OOP works?

Rust is not a pure OOP language. It's a mix of OOP and functional programming. Rust uses a concept called **traits**,
similar to interfaces in other languages, but are also able to provide default method implementations,
generic methods, and associated types. <br>
<br>
There is no inheritance in Rust, but you can use the **trait object** to simulate it. <br>

Example:

```Rust
trait Shape {
    fn draw(&self);

    fn hello_world(&self) {
        println!("Hello, world!");
    }
}

struct Circle {
    color: String
}

impl Shape for Circle {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Je suis un cercle de couleur {}.", self.color);
    }
}

struct Square {
    color: String
}

impl Shape for Square {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Je suis un carr√© de couleur {}.", self.color);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut shapes: Vec<Box<dyn Shape>> = Vec::new();
    shapes.push(Box::new(Circle { color: String::from("rouge") }));
    shapes.push(Box::new(Square { color: String::from("bleu") }));

    for shape in shapes.iter() {
        shape.draw();
        shape.hello_world();
    }
}
```
```bash
Je suis un cercle de couleur rouge.
Hello, world!
Je suis un carr√© de couleur bleu.
Hello, world!
```

## Isometric game

An isometric game is a game that uses an isometric projection. It's a way to represent a 3D world on a 2D
screen. It's used in many games (particularly Old School RPGs) to give a 3D feeling to the game.

There is no tricky math to do to make an isometric game. You just have to draw the textures at the right
position. <br>
<br>

> **Note**: Dofus is a good example of an isometric game.
